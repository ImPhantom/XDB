# XDB (Xeno Discord Bot)

I started making this bot while taking breaks developing my garry's mod server, we have a discord for our players to use and it got
a little clustered with s**tposts and other random stuff that has no use in a discord chat. Since my favorite moderation bot requires
you to have 100+ users in the discord before it can stay, I decided i would try to make my own bot that functions almost as well as the
other moderation bots ive tested.
