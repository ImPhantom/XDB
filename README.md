# XDB (Xeno Discord Bot)

This is a bot I started writing a few months back when RH1N0 decided to set their guild user limit to 100, which at the time my guild did not have. But I still wanted kick/ban with reasons, message logging, etc.

I also want to state that I am not completely fluent in C#, and I know most of this code is downright hideous. Im Sorry.

## whats planned?
a rewrite from the bottom up
- no more json data storage, (at least sqlite)
- less embeds
