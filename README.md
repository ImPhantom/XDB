# XDB (Xeno Discord Bot)

I started making this bot while taking breaks developing my garry's mod server, we have a discord for our players to use and it got
a little clustered with s**tposts and other random stuff that has no use in a discord chat. Since my favorite moderation bot requires
you to have 100+ users in the discord before it can stay, I decided I would try to make my own bot that functions almost as well as the
other moderation bots i've tested.

###Releases?
As of now XDB is being developed for private use. When I have a somewhat polished version I will begin uploading releases to GitHub/My Site.

###What API am I using? 
[Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) (rc546)

###To Do List

- ~~Proper JSON Config~~
- Word Filtering
- Steam Integration (query)
- Ban/Kick Logging (w/ reason)
- Guild Member Rankings
